- support for struct/class/union/typedef
- get operator overloading to re-support ostream <<
- make datatypes not depend on existence of static objects
- get showerror working again, maybe use a string buffer?
- consider getting rid of using istream for lexer
- should we force references for non-numeric parameters?
- should we get rid of the readline stuff for now?
- make madc a library (libmadc.so) that madc binary uses
