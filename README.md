## Mad-C Programming Language (My jit-Assembled Dialect of C)

---

This is my answer to a simple C-like language to use stand alone, or embedded, which is JIT assembled/compiled.

My goals are:
1. Make it fast
2. Keep it small
3. Make it easy to use

It currently only requires the asmjit library, and a C++ compiler.
